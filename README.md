# Piglatin

This Program transforms a string passed as argument in its Pig Latin version. If a word begins with a vowel, just add "ay" to the end. If it begins with a consonant, then we take all consonants before the first vowel and we put them on the end of the word and add "ay" at the end. e.g pig becomes igpay
